# 🛠️ Sorting Visualizer 🛠️
Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer! This project provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms to help understand and compare their efficiencies and behaviors.
# 🎯 Overview
- In its current skeleton phase, this project features:
- Generate array button: Creates a random array of elements.
- Bubble sort button: Initiates the bubble sort algorithm.
- Merge sort button: Initiates the merge sort algorithm.
- Size slider: Adjusts the size of the array for visualization.

## 🧩 Components
- HTML: Structures the interface.
- CSS: Styles the elements (to be improved).
- JavaScript: Powers the functionality and sorting algorithms.
## 🚀 Usage
1. Generate an array: Click "Generate array" to create a new random array.
2. Sort the array: Choose either "Bubble sort" or "Merge sort" to see the array being sorted visually.
3. Adjust array size: Use the range slider to change the number of elements in the array.

## 📋 To-Do
* Enhance visual styling.
* Add more sorting algorithms.
* Improve user interface and interaction.
